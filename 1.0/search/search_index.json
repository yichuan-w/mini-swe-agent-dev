Back then, we placed a lot of emphasis on tools and special interfaces for the agent. However, one year later, a lot of this is not needed at all to build a useful agent!</p> <p>In fact, mini-SWE-agent:</p> <ul> <li>Does not have any tools other than bash \u2014 it doesn't even use the tool-calling interface of the LMs.   This means that you can run it with literally any model.   When running in sandboxed environments you also don't need to take care of installing a single package \u2014 all it needs is bash.</li> <li>Has a completely linear history \u2014 every step of the agent just appends to the messages and that's it.   So there's no difference between the trajectory and the messages that you pass on to the LM.   Great for debugging &amp; fine-tuning.</li> <li>Executes actions with <code>subprocess.run</code> \u2014 every action is completely independent (as opposed to keeping a stateful shell session running). This makes it trivial to execute the actions in sandboxes (literally just switch out <code>subprocess.run</code> with <code>docker exec</code>) and to scale up effortlessly.   Seriously, this is a big deal, trust me.</li> </ul> <p>This makes it perfect as a baseline system and for a system that puts the language model (rather than the agent scaffold) in the middle of our attention. You can see the result on the SWE-bench (bash only) leaderboard, that evaluates the performance of different LMs with <code>mini</code>.</p> Why use mini-SWE-agent as a tool? <p>Some agents are overfitted research artifacts. Others are UI-heavy frontend monsters.</p> <p><code>mini</code> wants to be a hackable tool, not a black box.</p> <ul> <li>Simple enough to understand at a glance</li> <li>Convenient enough to use in daily workflows</li> <li>Flexible to extend</li> </ul> <p>Unlike other agents (including our own swe-agent), it is radically simpler, because it:</p> <ul> <li>Does not have any tools other than bash \u2014 it doesn't even use the tool-calling interface of the LMs.   Instead of implementing custom tools for every specific thing the agent might want to do, the focus is fully on the LM utilizing the shell to its full potential.   Want it to do something specific like opening a PR?   Just tell the LM to figure it out rather than spending time to implement it in the agent.</li> <li>Executes actions with <code>subprocess.run</code> \u2014 every action is completely independent (as opposed to keeping a stateful shell session running).   This is a big deal for the stability of the agent, trust me.</li> <li>Has a completely linear history \u2014 every step of the agent just appends to the messages that are passed to the LM in the next step and that's it.   This is great for debugging and understanding what the LM is prompted with.</li> </ul> Should I use mini-SWE-agent or swe-agent? <p>You should use <code>mini-swe-agent</code> if</p> <ul> <li>You want a quick command line tool that works locally</li> <li>You want an agent with a very simple control flow</li> <li>You want even faster, simpler &amp; more stable sandboxing &amp; benchmark evaluations</li> <li>You are doing FT or RL and don't want to overfit to a specific agent scaffold</li> </ul> <p>You should use <code>swe-agent</code> if</p> <ul> <li>You need specific tools or want to experiment with different tools</li> <li>You want to experiment with different history processors</li> <li>You want very powerful yaml configuration without touching code</li> </ul> <p>What you get with both</p> <ul> <li>Excellent performance on SWE-Bench</li> <li>A trajectory browser</li> </ul> Simple UI (<code>mini</code>)  Visual UI (<code>mini -v</code>)  Batch inference Trajectory browser Python bindings More in the docs <pre><code>agent = DefaultAgent(\n    LitellmModel(model_name=...),\n    LocalEnvironment(),\n)\nagent.run(\"Write a sudoku game\")</code></pre> <ul> <li>Quick start</li> <li><code>mini</code></li> <li>FAQ</li> <li>Global configuration</li> <li>Yaml configuration</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#continue-reading","title":"Continue reading:","text":"launch Installation &amp; Quick Start <p>Get started with mini-SWE-agent</p> flash_on Usage: Simple UI <p>Learn to use the <code>mini</code> command</p> visibility Usage: Visual UI <p>Try the visual interface with <code>mini -v</code></p> help FAQ <p>Common questions and answers</p> settings Configuration <p>Setup and customize your agent</p> fitness_center Power up <p>Start hacking the agent!</p>"},{"location":"#news","title":"\ud83d\udce3 News","text":"<ul> <li>Nov 19: Gemini 3 Pro reaches 74% on SWE-bench verified with mini-swe-agent!</li> <li>Aug 19: New blogpost: Randomly switching between GPT-5 and Sonnet 4 boosts performance</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#new-features","title":"\ud83d\udce3 New features","text":"<p>Please check the github release notes for the latest updates.</p>"},{"location":"#documentation-updates","title":"\ud83d\udce3 Documentation updates","text":"<ul> <li>Jul 27: More notes on local models</li> </ul> bug_report Something broken/unclear? <p>Open an issue on GitHub!</p> help Open-ended discussions <p>Join our Slack!</p>"},{"location":"SECURITY/","title":"Security Policy","text":""},{"location":"SECURITY/#security-policy","title":"Security Policy","text":""},{"location":"SECURITY/#reporting-a-vulnerability","title":"Reporting a Vulnerability","text":"<p>Please contact Kilian Lieret (kl5675@princeton.edu), John Yang (johnby@stanford.edu), Carlos E.

There are two typical cases that we handle this way:</p> <ol> <li><code>TimeoutError</code>: the action took too long to execute (we show partial output)</li> <li><code>FormatError</code>: the output from the LM contained zero or multiple actions (we show the error message)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>DefaultAgent.run</code> method catches these exceptions and handles them by adding the corresponding message to the messages list and continuing the loop.</p> <pre><code>while True:\n    try:\n        self.step()\n    except NonTerminatingException as e:\n        self.add_message(\"user\", str(e))\n    except TerminatingException as e:\n        self.add_message(\"user\", str(e))\n        return type(e).__name__, str(e)\n</code></pre> <p>Using exceptions for the control flow is a lot easier than passing around flags and states, especially when extending or subclassing the agent.</p> bug_report Something broken/unclear? <p>Open an issue on GitHub!</p> help Open-ended discussions <p>Join our Slack!</p>"},{"location":"advanced/cookbook/","title":"Python bindings","text":""},{"location":"advanced/cookbook/#cookbook","title":"Cookbook","text":"<p>Remixing &amp; extending mini</p> <ul> <li>This guide shows how to mix the different components of the <code>mini</code> agent to create your own custom version.</li> <li>You might want to first take a look at the control flow of the default agent first</li> </ul> <p>Development setup</p> <p>Make sure to follow the dev setup instructions in quickstart.md.</p> <p>We provide several different entry points to the agent, for example hello world, or the default when calling <code>mini</code>.</p> <p>Want to cook up your custom version and the config is not enough?

For example:</p> <pre><code>run:\n  env_startup_command: \"apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python3-pip\"\n</code></pre> <p>The command is rendered with the instance variables as template variables using <code>jinja2</code>. For example, you could use</p> <pre><code>run:\n  env_startup_command: \"git clone {{ repo_url }} . --force\"\n</code></pre> <p>which might be particularly useful when running with environments like <code>bubblewrap</code>.</p> <p>What environment can I use for SWE-bench?</p> <p>See this guide for more details.</p>"},{"location":"usage/swebench/#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"Default config <ul> <li>Read on GitHub</li> </ul> <pre><code>agent:\n  system_template: |\n    You are a helpful assistant that can interact multiple times with a computer shell to solve programming tasks.\n    Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with &amp;&amp; or ||).\n\n    Include a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.\n    Format your response as shown in &lt;format_example&gt;.\n\n    &lt;format_example&gt;\n    THOUGHT: Your reasoning and analysis here\n\n    ```bash\n    your_command_here\n    ```\n    &lt;/format_example&gt;\n\n    Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.\n  instance_template: |\n    &lt;pr_description&gt;\n    Consider the following PR description:\n    {{task}}\n    &lt;/pr_description&gt;\n\n    &lt;instructions&gt;\n    # Task Instructions\n\n    ## Overview\n    You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\n    You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\n    Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\n    IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\n    For each response:\n    1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n    2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n    ## Important Boundaries\n    - MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n    - DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n    ## Recommended Workflow\n    1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n    2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n    3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n    4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n    5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n    ## Command Execution Rules\n    You are operating in an environment where\n    1. You write a single command\n    2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n    3. You see the result\n    4. You write your next command\n\n    Each response should include:\n    1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n    2. A single bash code block with your command\n\n    Format your responses like this:\n\n    &lt;format_example&gt;\n    THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\n    and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n    ```bash\n    your_command_here\n    ```\n    &lt;/format_example&gt;\n\n    Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n    ```bash\n    your_command_here\n    ```\n\n    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n    - Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n    - Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n    - This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with &amp;&amp; or ||)\n    - If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n    - Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n    - Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n    - However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir &amp;&amp; ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n    Example of a CORRECT response:\n    &lt;example_response&gt;\n    THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n    ```bash\n    ls -la\n    ```\n    &lt;/example_response&gt;\n\n    Example of an INCORRECT response:\n    &lt;example_response&gt;\n    THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n    ```bash\n    ls -la\n    ```\n\n    Now I'll read the file:\n\n    ```bash\n    cat file.txt\n    ```\n    &lt;/example_response&gt;\n\n    If you need to run multiple commands, either:\n    1. Combine them in one block using &amp;&amp; or ||\n    ```bash\n    command1 &amp;&amp; command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n    ```\n\n    2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n    ## Environment Details\n    - You have a full Linux shell environment\n    - Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n    - Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n    - If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n    ## Useful Command Examples\n\n    ### Create a new file:\n    ```bash\n    cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' &gt; newfile.py\n    import numpy as np\n    hello = \"world\"\n    print(hello)\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n    ### Edit files with sed:\n    ```bash\n    # Replace all occurrences\n    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n    # Replace only first occurrence\n    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n    # Replace first occurrence on line 1\n    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\n    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n    ```\n\n    ### View file content:\n    ```bash\n    # View specific lines with numbers\n    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n    ```\n\n    ### Any other command you want to run\n    ```bash\n    anything\n    ```\n\n    ## Submission\n    When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\n    issue exactly the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT &amp;&amp; git add -A &amp;&amp; git diff --cached\n    ```\n\n    This command will submit your work.\n    You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n    &lt;/instructions&gt;\n  action_observation_template: |\n    &lt;returncode&gt;{{output.returncode}}&lt;/returncode&gt;\n    {% if output.output | length &lt;
